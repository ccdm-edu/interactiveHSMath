		"expln": "Synthesized Tone.  Sine and Cosine functions, when translated to voltage and sent to a speaker are just tones. Pure tones of one frequency only. As the amplitude changes it gets louder/softer.  You can't hear slow phase changes. If you change phase very fast, it sounds like pops in the speaker.  As you change frequency, you can move from low bass up to the midrange of human hearing at 10,000 Hz.  Musical notes are made up of a fundamental frequency, which is one of the tones you create here plus some harmonics and overtones that give the instrument its richness.  This is why a trumpet playing X has a fundamental frequency Y and a violin playing Z has the same fundamental frequency.  They sound similar but the difference is in the other smaller tones that get added in to create the unique sound."

The waveform looks alot like a sine wave at the fundamental tone shown.  The overtones and harmonics give the signal its richness and helps distinguish a trumpet from a guitar from a flute etc.  (Note 1:  Signal read from a mp3 file of someone playing the note, it is digitized voltage sent to a speaker and plotted as a function of time)"
