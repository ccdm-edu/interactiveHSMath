		"expln": "Synthesized Tone.  Sine and Cosine functions, when translated to voltage and sent to a speaker are just tones. Pure tones are of one frequency only. As the amplitude changes it gets louder/softer.  You can't hear slow phase changes. If you change phase very fast, it sounds like pops in the speaker.  As you change frequency, you can move from low bass up to the midrange of human hearing at 10,000 Hz.  Musical notes are made up of a fundamental frequency, which is one of the tones you create here plus some harmonics and overtones that give the instrument its richness.  You can use the synthesized tones produced here to tune an instrument using the trig formulas you are also studying"

		"expln": "Bflat trumpet playing C tuning note, which is ideally at 466.16 Hz.  The orange line is the waveform created by the trumpet.  You can see the trumpet waveform is periodic, like the sine wave, however this trumpet is out of tune so the sine wave matches up at 480 Hz.  One could synthesize this trumpet sound by using a tone at the fundamental frequency and adding in other tones at different frequencies/phases/amplitudes to give this unique waveform shape and sound."
