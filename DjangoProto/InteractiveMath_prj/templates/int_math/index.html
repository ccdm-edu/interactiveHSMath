						This math website is designed to connect the theories and equations in Algebra 2 and PreCalculus to the real world in a way that is <span id="blinkingColor">fun </span>and interactive.  
						You will see how trig functions play into music and (eventually) imaginary numbers help your cell phone send your text messages. 
						<br>
						It looks best on a laptop/desktop/tablet/notebook. Your mobile will work as well but its too small to see all the animations at once.  
						<br>
						This site will ALWAYS be FREE to learners, never a charge of any kind for ANY of the material.<br>
						<br> Math is <b>literally</b> everywhere! <br>
						Enjoy!
