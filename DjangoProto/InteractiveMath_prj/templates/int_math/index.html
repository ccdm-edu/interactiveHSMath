		<p>In tutoring high school students for several years, I have found many who have complained that they have to "memorize all these stupid, useless equations".  
		As an engineer, I want to explain how these "stupid" equations are found through out the their world and are the building blocks of technology.  This site
		is designed to give high schoolers a taste of what college students learn in a <span id="blinkingColor">fun </span>and interactive way.  We take the stuff students
		have to know for their exams and tie it to cool stuff, like Music, like cell phones, like drones.  Look through the tabs, you'll see it in action.

		This site is intended to cover Algebra 2 and Geometry, eventually.  Only one person is writing code for this site so progress is
		slow.  As of now, it is tested only on Chrome web browser and generally works under Firefox and is flaky under Safari.  It looks best on a laptop/desktop/notebook, untested on mobile devices.  Enjoy!
