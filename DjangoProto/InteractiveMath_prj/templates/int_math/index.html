		In tutoring high school students for several years, I have found many who have complained that they have to "memorize all these stupid, useless equations".  
		As an engineer, I want to explain how these "stupid" equations are found through out the their world and are the building blocks of technology.  This site
		is designed to give high schoolers a taste of what college students learn in a <span id="blinkingColor">fun </span>and interactive way.  
		<br></br>
		<noscript>Since this site is interactive, Javascript <font size="+2">MUST </font>be enabled to fully experience the site.
		You do not have Javascript enabled in your browser. <br></br></noscript>

		This site is intended to cover Algebra 2 and Geometry, eventually.  Only one person is writing code for this site so progress is
		slow.  As of now, it is tested only on Chrome web browser and generally works under Firefox and is flaky under Safari.  It looks best on a laptop/desktop/notebook, untested on mobile devices.  Enjoy!
