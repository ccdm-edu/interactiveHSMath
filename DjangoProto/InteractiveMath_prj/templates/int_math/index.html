					This website is designed to connect the theories and equations in Algebra 2 and PreCalculus to the real world in a way that is <span id="blinkingColor">fun </span>and interactive.  
					You will see how trig functions play into music and imaginary numbers help your cell phone send your text messages (and voice too). 
				<br><br>
					Only one person is writing code for this site so progress is
					slow.  As of now, it is tested only on Chrome web browser and generally works under Firefox/Edge and is flaky under Safari and no way on IE.  
					It looks best on a laptop/desktop/notebook.  
					This site needs more screen real-estate than a phone can give.  Its just NOT going to work well on your phone.  Maybe someday...<br>
					<br> Math is <b>literally</b> everywhere! <br>
					Enjoy!
