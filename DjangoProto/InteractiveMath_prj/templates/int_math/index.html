		<p>This website is designed to connect the "boring" stuff that high school students "have" to learn in Algebra 2 and Geometry and Advanced Math Topics to the real world in a way that is <span id="blinkingColor">fun </span>and interactive.  
		You will see how trig functions play into music and imaginary numbers help your cell phone send your text messages (and do everything else phones do).

		Only one person is writing code for this site so progress is
		slow.  As of now, it is tested only on Chrome web browser and generally works under Firefox/Edge and is flaky under Safari and no way on IE.  It looks best on a laptop/desktop/notebook.  This site needs more screen real-estate than a phone can give.  Its just NOT going to work well on your phone.  Maybe someday...<br>Enjoy!
