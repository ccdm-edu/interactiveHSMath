	    <p class="AdvTopic_ToDo"> TRY THIS:  Turn on your speaker.  Hit Start Tone and adjust Frequency and notice the pitch goes up and down.  
	    Adjust Amplitude and notice only the volume changes.  Adjust Phase slowly and note there is no perceived change but if you change it quickly, you can get a popping sound.  
		</p>
	    <p class="AdvTopic_Expln"> EXPLANATION:  Synthesized Tone.  Sine and Cosine functions, when translated to voltage and sent to a speaker are just tones. Pure tones are of one frequency only. 
	    As the amplitude increases, the sound gets louder and as the amplitude decreases, it gets softer.  You can see this in the equation for the tone.
	    Phase only has meaning if you compare it to some reference.  As you adjust phase, that reference is what
	    you heard just a few milliseconds ago.  If you change the phase slowly, the waveform of what you hear and what you just heard are pretty darn close.  Thus, you can't hear slow phase changes. 
	    However, if you change phase very fast, it can sound like pops in the speaker.  
	    This is because when the phase changes quickly, you are comparing current phase with an older version which is way off.
	    This can produce a large discontinuity in the waveform and this sounds like a pop.  
	    When you adjust the frequency slider, you change the pitch and you can move from low bass up to the midrange of human hearing at 10,000 Hz.  
	    Musical notes as played on various instruments, are made up of a pitch frequency, plus harmonics and overtones that give the instrument its rich sound.  
	    We will look at this more on the next page.
