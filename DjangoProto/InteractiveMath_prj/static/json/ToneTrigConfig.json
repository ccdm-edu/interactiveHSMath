		"expln": "EXPLANATION:  B<sup><span>&#9837;</span></sup> trumpet playing C<sub>5</sub> note, which comes out as B<sup><span>&#9837;</span></sup>, ideally at 466.16 Hz.  The orange line is the waveform created by the trumpet.  You can see the trumpet waveform is periodic, like the sine wave, and at (approximately) the same fundamental frequency as the sine wave tone. If you have a musically trained ear, you may hear a beat note with the synthesized tone since this trumpet is 2 Hz out of tune.  <br><br>An instrument plays a note but the sound/pitch depend on what group the instrument belongs to.  The trumpet, clarinet, soprano sax are all B<sup><span>&#9837;</span></sup> instruments.  So C<sub>5</sub> for these instruments has the same pitch frequency as the sine wave shown.  Try loading up some other instrument waveforms!  All waveforms will have the same fundamental pitch frequency (or an octave lower in the case of the tenor sax) but the waveforms will be shaped differently for each instrument, giving each instrument it's own unique sound.  One could synthesize this trumpet sound by using a tone at the pitch frequency of 466.16Hz and adding in other tones at different phases/amplitudes and frequencies that are multiples of the pitch frequency (i.e. 2*466.16Hz, 3*466.16Hz, etc) to obtain this unique waveform shape and sound."
