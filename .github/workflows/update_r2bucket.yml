# Figure out the github repo files of interest that have changed and copy/slam the new version into Cloudflare R2 bucket
# I chose to use existing Github actions that were well accepted by community. Therefore, it uses an action that copies a whole 
# directory to a Cloudflare directory (with matching name).  Yes, this will use up unneeded "write" actions since not all files in directory changed but should be ok.  
# In Github actions marketplace, there is no delete of removed files from R2 bucket--this will leave excess clutter in Cloudflare bucket to be 
# (maybe) manually cleaned but not a problem at this point.  Another inefficiency is when a file is deleted in repo, this is marked as change and whole
# directory is copied over again, needlessly, and the deleted file still remains in r2.
# All of this and its inefficiencies consumes way less space in Cloudflare R2 than allowing
# a clone of the repo into the bucket.  At this time, it saves me a factor of 10 is space.
