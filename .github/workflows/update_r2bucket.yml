# Figure out static code files that have changed and copy/slam the new version into Cloudflare R2 bucket
# I chose to use existing Github actions that were well accepted by community. Therefore, it uses an action that copies a whole 
# directory to a Cloudflare directory (with matching name).  Yes, this will use up unneeded "write" actions but should be ok.  There is no 
# delete of removed files--this will leave excess clutter in Cloudflare bucket to be (maybe) manually cleaned but not a problem at this point.
