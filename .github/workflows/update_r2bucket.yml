#Github action update_r2bucket.yml
# GOAL:
# Changes are made to static code repo and are tested on test website for various devices.  These changes->testing->changes etc
# can result in several files from several directories being updated.  We want to save all these updates in a config file so 
# when testing is finally done we have a full list of files (or really directories) that have changed since we last completed
# testing and that need to be written to R2 bucket.  It is anticipated that a human will write True/False to the config file TestingComplete 
# pair in the config file (r2upload_config.json) to signify testing is ongoing or complete.

# DESIGN NOTES
# Figure out the github repo files of interest that have changed and copy/slam the new version into Cloudflare R2 bucket
# I chose to use existing Github actions that were well accepted by community. Therefore, it uses an action that copies a whole 
# directory to a Cloudflare directory (with matching name).  Yes, this will use up unneeded "write" actions since not all files in directory changed but should be ok.  
# In Github actions marketplace, there is no delete of removed files from R2 bucket--this will leave excess clutter in Cloudflare bucket to be 
# (maybe) manually cleaned but not a problem at this point.  Another inefficiency is when a file is deleted in repo, this is marked as change and whole
# directory is copied over again, needlessly, and the deleted file still remains in r2.
# All of this and its inefficiencies consumes way less space in Cloudflare R2 than allowing
# a clone of the repo into the bucket.  At this time, it saves me a factor of 10 is space.
